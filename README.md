### Hey I'm ÔΩäÔΩèÔΩÖ , Security researcher and reverse engineer im mostly interested in Windows kernel development, Cheat Development and low-level programming. 
been out of the cheat development scene for a few months due to extreme presure and being a solo developer on a cheat with 400+ users was just stressful for me so here is my chill spot.
